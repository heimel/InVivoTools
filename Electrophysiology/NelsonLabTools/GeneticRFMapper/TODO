TODO list for GeneticRFMapper
-------------------------------------

- make complex cell model for simulation (some references in Sceniak,
  Hawken and Shapley)

- improve GA simulation program in general

- change response to many bins and fitness to sum

- check to see if plot_chromosome and shown stimuli match. (at least
  it seems upside down)

- last response in minimize_stimulus is always zero. repair

- the continue option in waiting for the extraction causes the program
  to crash. repair.

- better way to store all populations and generations, to later see
  what happened

- implement Boltzmann selection

- add global speed and orientation preferences and implement Sacha's
  suggestion of more knowledge about receptive fields.

- make it possible to not sample not only uniformly but also from
  other distributions 

- stimulus density should be related to size & windowsize 

- use different procedure to see if extracting is finished (at least
  ask for confirmation when there are zero spikes)

- save parameters in log file and presentation time of one generation
