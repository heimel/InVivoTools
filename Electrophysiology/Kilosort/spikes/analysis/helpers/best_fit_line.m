function [m,p,s] = best_fit_line(x,y,z)

% x,y,z are n x 1 column vectors of the three coordinates
% of a set of n points in three dimensions. The best line,
% in the minimum mean square orthogonal distance sense,
% will pass through m and have direction cosines in p, so
% it can be expressed parametrically as x = m(1) + p(1)*t,
% y = m(2) + p(2)*t, and z = m(3)+p(3)*t, where t is the
% distance along the line from the mean point at m.
% s returns with the minimum mean square orthogonal
% distance to the line.
