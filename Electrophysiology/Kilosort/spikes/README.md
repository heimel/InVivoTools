# Spikes
Code for electrophysiology analysis from the lab of Kenneth Harris and Matteo Carandini at UCL. There are in particular a number of methods useful specifically for Neuropixels recordings.

See exampleScript.m for some pointers to functions useful for Neuropixels analysis. See [here](https://github.com/cortex-lab/neuropixels/wiki/Other_analysis_methods) for a walkthrough of these functions. 

Functions for open ephys recordings:
* Convert open ephys (OE format) to .dat, save sync information - oe2dat
* Convert open-ephys (KWIK format) to .dat, save sync information - kwik2dat
