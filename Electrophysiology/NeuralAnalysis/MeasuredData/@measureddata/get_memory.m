function b = get_memory(measdata,interval)

%  Part of the NeuralAnalysis package
%
%  B = GET_SIZE(MEASDATA [, INTERVAL])
%
%  Returns the size (in bytes) of the data in the MEASUREDDATA object MEASDATA.
%  If INTERVAL is given, then the amount of memory that would be used to return
%  the data in the interval (i.e., if GET_DATA were called).
