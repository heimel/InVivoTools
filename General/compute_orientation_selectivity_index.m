%     by the sum of all responses: 
%     OSI = ((Sigma R(phi_i)sin(2phi_i))^2 + (Sigma R(phi_i)cos(2phi_i))^2)^(1/2)/Sigma R(phi_i),
%     where phi_i is the orientation of each stimulus and R(phi_i) is the 
%     response to that stimulus (Ringach et al., 2002 and Worgotter and 
%     Eysel, 1987; Note: OSI = 1 - circular variance)"
%     and for the suppression index
