function [H, pValue, W] = swtest(x, alpha, tail)
%SWTEST Shapiro-Wilk parametric hypothesis test of composite normality.
%   [H, pValue, SWstatistic] = SWTEST(X, ALPHA, TAIL) performs
%   the Shapiro-Wilk test to determine if the null hypothesis of
%   composite normality is a reasonable assumption regarding the
%   population distribution of a random sample X. The desired significance 
%   level, ALPHA, is an optional scalar input (default = 0.05).
%   TAIL indicates the type of test (default = 1).
%
%   The Shapiro-Wilk hypotheses are: 
%   Null Hypothesis:        X is normal with unspecified mean and variance.
%      For TAIL =  0 (2-sided test), alternative: X is not normal.
%      For TAIL =  1 (1-sided test), alternative: X is upper the normal.
%      For TAIL = -1 (1-sided test), alternative: X is lower the normal.
%
%   This is an omnibus test, and is generally considered relatively
%   powerful against a variety of alternatives.
%   Shapiro-Wilk test is better than the Shapiro-Francia test for
%   Platykurtic sample. Conversely, Shapiro-Francia test is better than the
%   Shapiro-Wilk test for Leptokurtic samples.
%
%   When the series 'X' is Leptokurtic, SWTEST performs the Shapiro-Francia
%   test, else (series 'X' is Platykurtic) SWTEST performs the
%   Shapiro-Wilk test.
% 
%    [H, pValue, SWstatistic] = SWTEST(X, ALPHA, TAIL)
%
% Inputs:
%   X - a vector of deviates from an unknown distribution. The observation
%     number must exceed 3 and less than 5000.
%
% Optional inputs:
%   ALPHA - The significance level for the test (default = 0.05).
%
%   TAIL  - The type of the test (default = 1).
%  
% Outputs:
%  SWstatistic - The test statistic (non normalized).
%
%   pValue - is the p-value, or the probability of observing the given
%     result by chance given that the null hypothesis is true. Small values
%     of pValue cast doubt on the validity of the null hypothesis.
%
%     H = 0 => Do not reject the null hypothesis at significance level ALPHA.
%     H = 1 => Reject the null hypothesis at significance level ALPHA.
