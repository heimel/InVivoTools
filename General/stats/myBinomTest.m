%function pout=myBinomTest(s,n,p,Sided)
%
% Performs a binomial test of the number of successes given a total number 
% of outcomes and a probability of success. Can be one or two-sided.
%
% Inputs:
%       s-      (Scalar or Array) The observed numebr of successful outcomes
%       n-      (Scalar or Array) The total number of outcomes (successful or not)
%       p-      (Scalar or Array) The proposed probability of a successful outcome
%       Sided-  (String) can be 'one', 'two' (the default), or 'two, equal 
%               counts'. A value of 'one' will perform a one-sided test to
%               determine if the observed number of successes are either 
%               significantly greater than or less than the expected number
%               of successes, depending on whether s is greater than or less 
%               than the observed number of successes. 'Two' will use the
%               method of small p-values (see reference below) to perform a
%               two-tailed test to calculate the probability of observing
%               any equally unlikely or more unlikely value greater than or
%               less than the expected number of successes (ie with the 
%               same cdf value of the distribution. 'Two, equal counts' 
%               will perform a two-sided test that the that the actual 
%               number of success is different from the expected number of 
%               successes in any direction.
%
% Outputs:
%       pout-   The probability of observing the resulting value of s or
%               another value more extreme (the precise meaning of which 
%               depends on the value of Sided) given n total outcomes with 
%               a probability of success of p.               
%
%       s, n and p can be scalars or arrays of the same size. The
%       dimensions and size of pout will match that of these inputs.
%
%   For example, the signtest is a special case of this where the value of p
%   is equal to 0.5 (and a 'success' is dfeined by whether or not a given
%   sample is of a particular sign.), but the binomial test and this code is 
%   more general allowing the value of p to be any value between 0 and 1.
%
%   The results when Sided='two' and when Sided='two, equal counts' are 
%   identical only when p=0.5, but are different otherwise. For more
%   description, see the second reference below.
