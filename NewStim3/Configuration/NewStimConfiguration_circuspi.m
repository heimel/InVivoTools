% if this computer IS the remote computer, then this section is unimportant

Remote_Comm_remotearchitecture = 'unix'; % options are 'PC', 'Mac' (MacOS9), or 'unix' (Linux, MacOSX)
% the computer type of the remote machine you are talking to (not of THIS computer, necessarily)

Remote_Comm_localprefix = 'C:\Data'; % for example, 'Z:', 'z:', '/Users/Shared/myexperimentdir'
% the prefix to the shared directory on THIS computer

Remote_Comm_remoteprefix = '/mnt/THISHOSTNAME/data';
% the prefix to the same directory as viewed by the OTHER computer

% Example, suppose your "master" computer is a PC running Windows, and you
% want to use the directory 'C:\Users\VHLabRig2\remote'.  You share the 'C' drive
% (say with the "share" name 'VHLabRig2', and mount it on your stimulus computer
% (say this computer is a MacOSX computer).  When the MacOSX stimulus computer
% mounts the drive from your "master" computer, it will probably see it as
% '/Volumes/VHLabRig2/Users/VHLabRig2/remote'.
% So, on your master computer (the PC) you would set
% Remote_Comm_remotearchitecture = 'MacOSX';
% Remote_Comm_localprefix = 'C:';
% Remote_Comm_remoteprefix = '/Volumes/VHLabRig2';

%        * serial port triggering, via StimSerial (see "help StimSerial")
%            the start of a stimscript is indicated by a trigger on one serial port
%            the start of each stimulus is indicated by a trigger on another serial port
%        * stimulus reporting via parallel port using National Instruments PCI-DIO-96
%            the stimulus number is reported on the parallel port according
%                to Fitzpatrick lab protocol

% StimSerial, for sending messages over serial port in Mac OS9.
% Use portlist = serial('Ports') for a list of ports on your Mac.
% use system('setserial -bg /dev/ttyS*') on linux
% Available pins are 'dtr' (pin 4 of DE-9 serial port, or pin 20 of a DB-25
% port) and 'rts' (pin 7 of DE-9 port, or pin 4 of DB-25 port)
