3/14/2001 - t003 - square counterphase, shift is -0.00127e-5
3/15/2001 - t006 - field, shift is -0.0005538e-5
3/15/2001 - t007 - field immediately following, shift is same
3/15/2001 - t008 - field "", shift is same
3/15/2001 - t009 - field after reboot of hedgehog, shift is +0.0003038e-5;

worried that these shifts might be multiples of many shifts
re-doing with gratings which stamp every other screen frame
3/15/2001 - t011 - drifting sinewave, shift is 0.00034e-5
3/15/2001 - t013 - drifting sinewave, shift is 0.00058e-5 ~ 30 minutes after
3/15/2001 - t014 - drifting sinewave, shift is 0.00058e-5 ~ 2 minutes after
3/15/2001 - t015 - drifting sinewave, shift is 0.00058e-5 ~ 2 minutes after
             still slight drift at that shift, but could probably make it better
resetting matlab but not rebooting

3/15/2001 - t023 - drifting sinewave, shift is -0.00075e-5 ~ 35 minutes after
next day but still same files
did not run NewStimInit and restarted stimuli
3/15/2001 - t024 - drifting sinewave but retrospect message
3/15/2001 - t025 - shift is -0.00075e-5
3/15/2001 - t026 - restarted matlab, a lot later
