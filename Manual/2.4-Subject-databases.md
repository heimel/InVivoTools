## Subject databases

InVivoTools comes with a number of databases. The controls look all roughly similar, but each comes with some additional specific buttons.

### Mice - mouse_db

Welfare form will produce a form which can be used as yellow card cage form for use in the IWO stables and as well fare form for the D2 lab. Information about the DEC protocol is retrieved from the protocol dec_db. 

Schedule will list the scheduled experiments for mice in the database for the next two weeks. 
Next number produces the next available dec number if the protocol and group number have been entered in the mouse field.	

List gives a list of all mice or the current selection in the Matlab command window.

Order form will make a mouse order form.

Info links the current mouse to the MS Access mouse database.


### Protocols - dec_db

Show will show the protocolâ€™s pdf if it is present in the folder InVivo/Databases/../../DEC, which on the network will be //vs01/Shared/DEC.

Available will calculate the number of mice still available by deducting the number of mice of each group that have a record in the mouse database.

Welfare form produces an example welfare form with the DEC protocol information.
