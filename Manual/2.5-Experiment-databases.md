## Experiment databases

To influence which experiment is loaded, set the experiment name by

    experiment('12.23')

to load the databases for your specific DEC protocol or experiment, where 12.23 should of course be replaced by your own dec-protocol number or another descriptive name for the group of experiment. You can also select

    experiment('')

to open the common database. To open the databases from all experiments, use

    experiment('all')

or, equivalently,

    experiment all 

  

Which experimental database is opened by default can also depend on the computer the software is ran on. The mimic another computer use e.g.

    host('daneel')

where `'daneel'` should be replaced by the computer you want to pretend to work on.

  

### Analysis parameters

For all analyses, there are specific parameters. These are set in oiprocessparams.m, tpprocessparams and ecprocessparams.m for optical imaging, two-photon imaging and electrophysiology. These files are under version control. If you need temporary changes in your analysis, make a copy of the file processparams_local_org.m to processparams_local.m anywhere in your path. Then edit this new file and add the parameters with the required overriding settings. This new file is not under version control.

### Optical imaging - experiment_db

![](https://github.com/heimel/InVivoTools/blob/master/Manual/invivotools_figures/oi_database.png)

Stimulus will start NewStim’s RunExperiment window for visual stimulation control. The button only appears on computers where Psychophysics Toolbox is installed.

Analyse will analyse the acquired data.

Results shows the results. 

Pull down test button next to [Results] is used for selecting the next test. When [+] is clicked to create a new record, some values will already be filled in depending on which test is selected in 

this pull down.

Close figs will close all not persisent figures, i.e. not the database control and record forms.

### Electrophysiology - ectestdb

![](https://github.com/heimel/InVivoTools/blob/master/Manual/invivotools_figures/ec_database.png)

Stimulus will start NewStim’s RunExperiment window for visual stimulation control. The button only appears on computers where Psychophysics Toolbox is installed.

Analyse will analyse the acquired data.

Results shows the results. 

Pull down test button next to [Results] is used for selecting the next test. When [+] is clicked to create a new record, some values will already be filled in depending on which test is selected in 

this pull down.

Close figs will close all not persisent figures, i.e. not the database control and record forms.

### Two-photon imaging - tptestdb

Laser will start control_lasergui to control the MaiTai laser power and wavelength. The button only appears on Wall-e, the two-photon analysis computer.

Stimulus will start NewStim’s RunExperiment window for visual stimulation control. The button only appears on computers where Psychophysics Toolbox is installed.

Analyse will analyse open the Analyzetpstack window for image/movie analysis. See [https://sites.google.com/site/alexanderheimel/protocols/puncta-analysis-using-matlab](https://sites.google.com/site/alexanderheimel/protocols/puncta-analysis-using-matlab) for more info on this window.

Results shows a preview image of the data and some of the acquisition parameters. 

Pull down test button next to [Results] is used for selecting the next test. When [+] is clicked to create a new record, some values will already be filled in depending on which test is selected in 

this pull down.

Close figs will close all not persisent figures, i.e. not the database control and record forms.

Blind temporarily removes date and comment information and reproducably random (but based on the details of the record) reverses or not the sequence of records for a specific mouse and stack.

Reverse reverses the order of the time series of a selected stack.

  

### Fields

![](https://github.com/heimel/InVivoTools/blob/master/Manual/invivotools_figures/tp_record.png)

##### ref_epoch

The name of an epoch used as reference. It can also be a selection criterium which can be used as a filter to uniquely identify a record as reference.

##### datatype

Use 'tp' for most cases, also for confocal or other images. Use 'fret' when a FRET sensor is imaged, so that the analysis will be done using a ratio of channels. Note: much of the FRET analysis may not be implemented yet.
