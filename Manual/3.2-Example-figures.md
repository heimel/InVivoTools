## Example figures
This part explains by a number of examples have to use graph_db to produce figures from data stored in one in the InVivoTools experimental databases. 

First, to get the graph_db examples database, fire up matlab and type:

    experiment(‘Examples’)
    graph_db

### Simple examples
Go to the first record by clicking on the [ |&lt; ] button or by typing 1 in the current record edit field next to the [ &lt; ] button.

#### Example 01 odi
You will see a record with few fields filled in:

![](https://github.com/heimel/InVivoTools/blob/master/Manual/invivotools_figures/example_odi_300x.png)

name: optional, but useful to find back your graph. Name is also used as default filename if none is given

group: a comma-separated list of group names. In the simplest case, like here, the group names are used to match the initial characters of the mouse field in mouse_db. Here 05.01.1 will extract all records selected by the filter ‘mouse=05.01.1*’ in the mouse_db

measures: a comma-separated list of measures, where measures take the form [DATATYPE:STIMTYPE:MEASURE]. Datatype can be e.g. ‘oi’, ‘ec’, ‘lfp’ for intrinsic signal, single-unit or lfp data respectively. Stimtype describes the stimulus, e.g. ‘od’ for an od test. Browse through the main graph_db for other examples. 

style: describes the type of graph, e.g. ‘bar’ or ‘xy’

color: Nx3 array, with in each row an RGB value for coloring each group. The RGB values should be between 0 and 1. 

spaced: when 1, spaces out the individual points over the width of the bar. Left most points are first records in the consult experiment database.

filename: name of saved figure, is created automatically at first compute, or can be manually chosen.

 

If you click [Compute], the figure shown on the right is produced.

#### Example 02 odi 2
If you move to the next graph record, we will see how to refine the figure a little, by changes in the following fields:

![](https://github.com/heimel/InVivoTools/blob/master/Manual/invivotools_figures/example_odi_2_300x.png)

groups: are now the names of records in the group database group_db. This database can be opened by clicking on [Groups] or through the Matlab prompt as group_db. In a group record, a complicated filter can be defined, or a preset color or label. See the section on the Group database for more informatio. 

test: name of the statistical test. Now the kruskal-wallis non-parametric test will be run instead of the default t-test. 

showpoints: when 0, the individual measurements are not shown.

prefax: if given as a 1x2 vector, the minimum and maximum y-limits. If given as a 1x4 vector, the minimum and maximum x-limits, followed by the y-limits.

grouplabels: comma-separated list of human-readable group labels. With \newline one can go to the next line. 

measurelabels: comma-separated list of measure labels.

extra_code: here unlimited extra matlab code can be insert to be run after creation of the graph. In this example additional labels are inserted with the text(x,y,’blabla’) command. 

signif_y: specificies for a selection of significance calculations whether the should be plotted, and if so at which height. The first column specificies the comparison number, which can be found at the Matlab command window after computing the figure. The second column has the height of the comparison line or NaN if it should not be plotted.

#### Example 03 contra vs ipsi
The next graph is of the xy type and shows the responses to stimuation of the contra lateral eye vs that to the ipsi lateral eye.

measures: in the measures field, you can write small calculation, like here a multiplication with 10 to get premille instead of percentage. Subtraction and division are also possible. Measures can also be added and subtracted from each other.

style: is now xy. 

showpoints: when it is 2, for each x-value only the mean of the associated y-values are shown, especially useful when x is a set parameter like contrast. 

prefax: now show the 1x4 format, with min x, max x, min y, max y

measurelabels: some tex like characters are available, like \Delta (Δ) or \alpha (α). Also an underscore will start subscript, and ^ superscript. Use curly braces to write multiple characters as sub- or superscript.

extra_options: there are many extra options. See below in the Fields section for an exhaustive list. Options are given as sets of two, with first the name of the option, ‘fit’ in this case, followed by the value, here ‘linear’. Options should not be repeated, because only the last one is taken into account. If one wants to select multiple words in the comment field, one would do ‘comment,{one,two}’

#### Example contra vs ipsi 2
This example shows how more computations with the data is possible.

measures: functions with a single argument can also be applied to the measure before plotting.

#### Example histogram
You can also make a histogram from the data.

![](https://github.com/heimel/InVivoTools/blob/master/Manual/invivotools_figures/example_histogram_record.png)
![](https://github.com/heimel/InVivoTools/blob/master/Manual/invivotools_figures/example_histogram_300x.png)


extra_options: uses here ‘bins’ which set the number of bins, and ‘min_snr’ which requires a minimum ‘signal-to-noise-ratio’ for the spike height versus noise. The argument ‘comment’ is followed by a string which should be in the comment field for a record to be included in the figure.

#### Example cumulative histogram
A cumulative histogram is especially useful for comparing two overlapping distributions. The example shows the latex convention of writing C_{50} for C50.

![](https://github.com/heimel/InVivoTools/blob/master/Manual/invivotools_figures/example_cumulative_histogram_300x.png)


extra_options shows here the selection of nicely isolated single units.

#### Example PSTH
A peristimulus time histogram has a whole range of x and y values.

### Example puncta gained and lost time series
Gain and loss time series can be made in two ways, which produce the same graph.

![](https://github.com/heimel/InVivoTools/blob/master/Manual/invivotools_figures/example_puncta_gain_record.png)

![](https://github.com/heimel/InVivoTools/blob/master/Manual/invivotools_figures/example_puncta_gain_record2.png)

![](https://github.com/heimel/InVivoTools/blob/master/Manual/invivotools_figures/example_puncta_gain_300x.png)


Either tp:timepoint_series, tp:lost_series and tp:gained_series measures are used, while setting a limit of the last timepoint, e.g. timepoint,28. Or one can use tp:timepoint,tp:lost,tp:gained, without a limit. If the same data is available for all timepoints, then these methods will yield identical results. If timepoints are missing, then the second way will show the partial data.
