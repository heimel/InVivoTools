## GUI: Database control

The main user interaction with the data is through a set of databases.  For each database a control and a record window are opened. The buttons on the control window may vary depending on the experiment type and host computer, but will always contain the following buttons:

![control_database](https://github.com/heimel/InVivoTools/blob/master/Manual/invivotools_figures/control_database.png)

The function of most buttons is straight forward. Some may require some extra explanation
#### Load	
Opens a window to select a database in the MATLAB format to load. It will open the database and create a lock file in the same folder with information of user and host.  Before opening it will check if such a lock file already exists, and in that case offer the choice to replace the lock file or open the database as read-only. Only if you are certain the lock file is a remnant of a crashed session replace it. 

#### Import
Open a window to select a database in MATLAB format to insert in currently open database behind the current record.

#### Export
Saves the whole database or the currently open selection to a different MATLAB file or a semi-colon separated CSV file. The latter could be loaded into Excel, but as the measures do not get exported well, this is not as useful as it could be. This could be developed further if there is a demand.

#### Sort
Sorts the database in ascending order of the first field.
Selecting and searching
One of the most useful things of the database control is the possibility to find a record or a selection of records by typing a selection critieria. For this criteria, you can use a number of operators:
* = equal
* ~ case-insensitive equal
* ! unequal
* < smaller than
* > larger than
* * match all
* , logical and
* | logical or
* () grouping brackets

Some example criteria are:

* mouse=12.10.1.21,test=t0001
* stim_type=ps,date>2012,reliable=1
* mouse = 05.01,type=*MD*
* mouse = 05.01,(type=*MD*p26|type=*MD*p27*)
* (cre=kazu,typing==0) | strain=*B6*
* recordnumber>600,reliable=1

You can also filter for recordnumber, if this is not a field in the database, but the recordnumber criterium has to be the first in the line, because the filtering is done sequentially. ‘reliable=1,recordnumber<10’ will select the first 10 reliable records, while ‘recordnumber<10,reliable=1’, will select the reliable records of the first set of 10 records. 

The toggle switch on the right hand side of the criteria edit box turns the filtering on and off.

### Access to databases
Temporary access to the the database struct array can be gained, by clicking the Help button in the control window. This will make the global variables `global_db` and `global_record`. `global_db` contains the database, `global_record` the current record. Note that changes in this database will not automatically enter the open database. Either use 

    ud = get(gcf,'userdata'); 
    ud.db = global_db; 
    set(gcf,'userdata','ud');
    control_db_callback(ud.h.current_record);
or close the database and start a new session with 

    control_db( global_db )
and save the database.

To access the database from a function, use

    [testdb, experimental_pc] = expdatabases( type );
    [db,filename] = load_testdb(testdb);
where type could be `oi`, `ec` or `tp`. To save the database use

    [filename,lockfile] = save_db(db, filename)
Type e.g. `help save_db` for more options.
