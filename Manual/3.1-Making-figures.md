## Making figures

Figures from experimental results can be produced by running

    graph_db

This opens the graph database.

### Group database - group_db

If you want, more complex groups selection, or reuse group labels and colours, you want to predefine your group as a record in the group database group_db.

The above record shows how filters can become arbitrarily complex. This group will select records which satisfy the specified filter (type=*control adult*,...) and which also belong to the groups given in the ‘combine’ field, which each have their own filters.

### Measure database - measure_db

The measure record defines a preferred label and averaging behavior (point), but does otherwise not add much to the direct entry of the type datatype:stim_type:measure into the graph record.
